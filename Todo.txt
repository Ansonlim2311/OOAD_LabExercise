2. Support for Multiple Creation Types
• Both are types of creation, and in future, the application should be able to expand 
with more creation types.
• Implement using inheritance or interface. For example, both AnimalItem and 
FlowerItem should extend a common abstract class or implement a shared 
interface.

4. Enhanced Toolbar with Icon-Based Controls
Design a toolbar with icon-based buttons (using JToolBar, JButton, and relevant icons) 
that supports the following:
• Add the custom image to the composition canvas (from library collection)
Toolbar should be built using modular methods to keep code clean and extensible.

5. Independent Rotation
• Enable individual creation items (animals, flowers, custom images) to be rotated 
independently.
• Allow the entire left canvas to also be rotated as a whole.
• Add rotation sliders or gesture-based rotation using MouseMotionListener.

6. Canvas Composition
• The resulting composed canvased should also be rotatable.

7. Mouse-Driven Transformations
Utilize mouse listeners (MouseListener, MouseMotionListener) to provide the 
following interactions:
• Flip animal images 
• Scale flower images proportionally through mouse interaction
• Transpose (move) custom drawn images 

8. File Operations
• Support drag-and-drop image import into the canvas (from library collection).
