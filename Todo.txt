5. Independent Rotation
• Enable individual creation items (animals, flowers, custom images) to be rotated 
independently.
• Allow the entire left canvas to also be rotated as a whole.
• Add rotation sliders or gesture-based rotation using MouseMotionListener.

6. Canvas Composition
• The resulting composed canvased should also be rotatable.

7. Mouse-Driven Transformations
Utilize mouse listeners (MouseListener, MouseMotionListener) to provide the 
following interactions:
• Flip animal images 
• Scale flower images proportionally through mouse interaction
